# A Collection of Short-term Projects 

This is a collection of mini-projects designed to improve my full-stack development skills for #include, and also includes one of my own mini-projects to practice making API requests and experimenting with a database.

## Framework & Tools
- Next.js
- React
- Nodemailer API
- Google Calendar API
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Ensure .env.local has a working Ethereal Email (expires after 48 hours)

Create a temporary email at https://ethereal.email/


### 3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Additional Info

I'm aware this project has major security issues, but for testing purposes, I left them. Plz don't abuse them...
